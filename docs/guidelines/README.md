## üîÑ Migration Guide

### From Previous Versions

#### Riverpod Migration (2.x ‚Üí 3.0)
- Update from dev versions to stable 3.0.0
- Replace `AutoDisposeNotifier` with unified `Notifier`
- Use new `Ref.mounted` patterns
- Implement new testing utilities

#### Dependencies Update
```yaml
# Key updates in pubspec.yaml
flutter_riverpod: ^3.0.0-dev.16
freezed: ^3.1.0
```

## üõ† Version Compatibility Matrix

| Component | Current Version | Minimum Required | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|-------|
| Flutter SDK | 3.24.0+ | 3.24.0 | Latest stable |
| Dart SDK | 3.5.0+ | 3.5.0 | Included with Flutter |
| Riverpod | 3.0.0 | 3.0.0 | Stable release |
| Supabase | 2.8.4+ | 2.8.0 | Latest features |
| GoRouter | 16.0.0+ | 14.0.0 | Modern routing |
| Freezed | 3.1.0+ | 3.0.0 | Dart 3 support |

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Code Generation Problems
```bash
# Clean and regenerate
dart run build_runner clean
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

#### Dependency Conflicts
```bash
# Reset dependencies
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

#### Riverpod Provider Issues
- Ensure providers are properly generated with `@riverpod` annotation
- Check for circular dependencies in provider graph
- Verify provider disposal in widget lifecycle

#### Navigation Issues
- Ensure GoRouter configuration is complete
- Check route path parameters and query strings
- Verify authentication guards and redirects

#### Performance Issues
- Run `flutter analyze` for static analysis warnings
- Profile with DevTools for runtime performance

### Getting Help

1. **Documentation**: Check relevant guideline files first
2. **Code Examples**: Look for patterns in existing codebase
3. **Team Support**: Reach out to team members for guidance
4. **External Resources**: See links section below

## üìä Performance Benchmarking

### Key Metrics to Monitor

- **App Startup Time**: < 3 seconds on average devices
- **Memory Usage**: < 100MB baseline, < 200MB peak
- **Frame Rate**: Maintain 60 FPS during normal operation
- **Build Time**: < 2 minutes for full clean build
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain > 80% code coverage
- **Code Quality**: Maintainability index > 50

### Benchmarking Tools

```bash
# Performance profiling
flutter run --profile --trace-startup

# Build analysis
flutter build apk --analyze-size

```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Best Practices Overview

1. **API Security**
   - Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization
   - Validate all user inputs and API responses

2. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
   - Implement proper session management
   - Follow GDPR and privacy regulations

3. **Code Security**
   - Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning
   - Secure coding practices and input validation
   - Proper error handling without information leakage

4. **Build Security**
   - Secure CI/CD pipelines and artifact management
   - Code signing for production releases
   - Environment separation and access controls
