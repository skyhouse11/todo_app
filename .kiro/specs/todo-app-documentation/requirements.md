#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a task THEN the system SHALL allow adding subtasks with their own completion status
2. WHEN a user creates a recurring task THEN the system SHALL automatically generate new instances based on the specified pattern
3. WHEN a user sets task dependencies THEN the system SHALL prevent marking dependent tasks as complete until prerequisites are finished
4. WHEN a user completes a parent task THEN the system SHALL require all subtasks to be completed first
5. WHEN a recurring task is completed THEN the system SHALL create the next instance according to the recurrence pattern

### Requirement 6: Collaboration and Sharing

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to share tasks and collaborate with others, so that we can work together on projects and track shared responsibilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

3. WHEN multiple users access a shared task THEN the system SHALL show real-time updates and prevent conflicts
4. WHEN a user comments on a task THEN the system SHALL notify other participants and maintain comment history
5. WHEN a shared task is modified THEN the system SHALL track who made changes and when

### Requirement 7: Data Persistence and Synchronization

**User Story:** As a user, I want my tasks to be saved reliably and synchronized across devices, so that I can access my data anywhere and never lose my work.
